# youtube-space-invaders
Simple space invaders game for the browser, getting more fun each release!

You can play the latest version of the game [here](https://quantuminformation.github.io/youtube-space-invaders/)

I used TypeScript as it is pretty nice for games and catches plenty bugs at compile time.

# Bot

In addition to the main web-based game, an artificial intelligence-based bot is under development to play the Space Invaders game developed by Nikos. More information about this bot can be found [here](./BOT.md).

# Conventions

Angles are measured clockwise from north. For example, east is 90 degrees.

# How to use in your own website

I published this over npm. All you need is to give the game object a 2D Canvas object and it will be added to your website.

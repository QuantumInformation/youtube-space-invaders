# Bot for Space Invaders

In addition to the main web-based game, an artificial intelligence-based bot is under development to play the Space Invaders game developed by Nikos. This AI uses reinforcement learning - more specifically, an actor-critic method of reinforcement learning - to gradually become better at playing the game after starting with no idea how to play it. The bot is developed using [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/), a version of the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) machine learning library developed specifically for use with JavaScript.
